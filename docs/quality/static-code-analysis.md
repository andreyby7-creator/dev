# Static Code Analysis

## Overview

Static code analysis system provides automatic security, performance, and code quality checks during development.

## System Components

### StaticAnalyzerService

Main service for code analysis with support for:

- **Security Analysis** - SQL injection detection, XSS, hardcoded secrets
- **Performance Analysis** - N+1 queries, synchronous operations, memory leaks
- **Maintainability Analysis** - cyclomatic complexity, code duplication
- **Best Practices Analysis** - console.log, unused imports, magic numbers

### Configuration

```typescript
interface IStaticAnalysisConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  rules: {
    security: boolean;
    performance: boolean;
    maintainability: boolean;
    bestPractices: boolean;
  };
  thresholds: {
    maxComplexity: number;
    minMaintainability: number;
    maxDuplication: number;
    minSecurityScore: number;
  };
  excludedPaths: string[];
}
```

### Quality Metrics

- **Cyclomatic Complexity** - code complexity
- **Maintainability Index** - maintainability index
- **Security Score** - security assessment
- **Performance Score** - performance assessment
- **Code Duplication** - duplication percentage

## Security Rules

### SQL Injection

Detects potential SQL injections:

- Using `${}` in SQL queries
- Missing parameterized queries

### XSS Vulnerability

Checks for XSS vulnerabilities:

- Using `innerHTML` and `outerHTML`
- Recommends `textContent` or sanitization

### Hardcoded Secrets

Detects hardcoded secrets:

- Passwords, keys, tokens in code
- Recommends environment variables

### Unsafe Crypto

Checks unsafe cryptographic functions:

- MD5, SHA1
- `Math.random()` for cryptography
- Recommends `crypto.randomBytes()` and `bcrypt`

## Performance Rules

### N+1 Query Pattern

Detects N+1 query pattern:

- `findOne` in `forEach` loop
- Recommends `include` or `join`

### Synchronous Operations

Checks synchronous operations:

- `fs.readFileSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`
- Recommends async/await

### Memory Leaks

Detects memory leaks:

- `setInterval` without `clearInterval`
- Recommends interval cleanup

## Maintainability Rules

### Cyclomatic Complexity

Checks function complexity:

- Threshold: 10
- Recommends breaking into smaller functions

### Maintainability Index

Checks maintainability index:

- Threshold: 65
- Recommends refactoring

### Code Duplication

Checks code duplication:

- Threshold: 15%
- Recommends extracting common functions

## Best Practices Rules

### Console.log

Detects `console.log` in production:

- Recommends logging through libraries

### Unused Imports

Detects unused imports:

- Recommends removal

### Magic Numbers

Detects magic numbers:

- Recommends constants

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

Static analysis integrated in CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Static Code Analysis
  run: |
    pnpm run lint
    pnpm run type-check
    pnpm run security-check
```

### Quality Gates

Configured quality thresholds:

- Security Score: ≥ 80
- Maintainability Index: ≥ 65
- Cyclomatic Complexity: ≤ 10
- Code Duplication: ≤ 15%

## Usage

### Analyze File

```typescript
const result = await staticAnalyzer.analyzeFile(filePath, content);
console.log(`Score: ${result.score}`);
console.log(`Issues: ${result.issues.length}`);
```

### Get Results

```typescript
const allResults = staticAnalyzer.getAllAnalysisResults();
const fileResult = staticAnalyzer.getAnalysisResult(filePath);
```

### Update Configuration

```typescript
staticAnalyzer.updateConfig({
  thresholds: {
    maxComplexity: 8,
    minSecurityScore: 85,
  },
});
```

## Reports

### Detailed Report

Includes:

- List of all issues with priorities
- Code quality metrics
- Fix recommendations
- Overall file score

### Statistics

- Number of analyzed files
- Average project score
- Top issues by type
- Quality trends

## Monitoring

### Quality Dashboard

Displays:

- Current project score
- Change history
- Issues by priority
- Fix progress

### Notifications

Automatic notifications for:

- Score below threshold
- Critical issues detected
- Quality improvements

## Best Practices

### Threshold Configuration

- Adapt thresholds to project
- Consider codebase complexity
- Gradually increase requirements

### Regular Analysis

- Run analysis on every commit
- Analyze entire project weekly
- Track quality trends

### Issue Resolution

- Prioritize by severity
- Fix critical issues immediately
- Plan refactoring for complex issues

## IDE Integration

### VSCode Extension

Extension for VSCode shows:

- Real-time issues
- Quick fixes
- Improvement suggestions

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky hooks check:

- Code quality before commit
- Block commits with critical issues
- Suggest automatic fixes
